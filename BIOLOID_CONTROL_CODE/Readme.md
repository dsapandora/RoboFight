Linux distributions have an AVR-GCC toolchain. It may not, however, be installed by default. For instructions about installing AVR-GCC for Linux, see the instructions for your particular distribution.

Usually multiple packages need to be installed. Here an exemplary list for the Ubuntu distribution:

gcc-avr	Compiler & Assembler
binutils-avr	Linker and some other useful tools
gdb-avr	Debugger for AVR Targets
avr-libc	The standard C library for the AVR series, including the required include files
avrdude	Programm to upload applications onto a AVR device
